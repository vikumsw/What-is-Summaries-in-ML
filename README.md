## What is Symbolic AI?
* Symbolic AI involves the explicit embedding of human knowledge and behavior rules into computer programs.
* Symbolic AI (or Classical AI) is the branch of artificial intelligence research that concerns itself with attempting to explicitly represent human knowledge in a declarative form (i.e. facts and rules).
* "Symbolic AI" = "Classical AI" = "Rule-based AI" = "Good old-fashioned AI"

## What is Bayesian Inference?
* Bayesian inference refers to the application of Bayesâ€™ Theorem in determining the updated probability of a hypothesis given new information.

## Frequentist Statistics
* Frequentist Statistics tests whether an event (hypothesis) occurs or not. It calculates the probability of an event in the long run of the experiment (i.e the experiment is repeated under the same conditions to obtain the outcome). Here, the sampling distributions of fixed size are taken. Then, the experiment is theoretically repeated infinite number of times but practically done with a stopping intention. For example, I perform an experiment with a stopping intention in mind that I will stop the experiment when it is repeated 1000 times or I see minimum 300 heads in a coin toss.
