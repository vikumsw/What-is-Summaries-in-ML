## What is Symbolic AI?
* Symbolic AI involves the explicit embedding of human knowledge and behavior rules into computer programs.
* Symbolic AI (or Classical AI) is the branch of artificial intelligence research that concerns itself with attempting to explicitly represent human knowledge in a declarative form (i.e. facts and rules).
* "Symbolic AI" = "Classical AI" = "Rule-based AI" = "Good old-fashioned AI"
